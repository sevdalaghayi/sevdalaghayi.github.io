<h2> About Me </h2>
	<p> Having grown up on a big farm, I've always loved nature, animals and the outdoors. Adventuring is my favourite thing to do! 
	    I love travelling and hope to someday do more travelling once COVID is over. Other then travelling, I love to cook and read self-help books. 
	   When I'm not reading, cooking or learning in school, I am most likely playing with my two pets, my cat Tigs and my dog Hugo. 
	
		
		<h2> School </h2>
		<p> Having grown up on a big farm, I've always loved nature, animals and the outdoors. 
		    This sparked my passion for the environment and encourgaed me to get a degree in Environmental Science.
		While in my undergrad, I participated in several volunteer opportunities including: turtle conservation, invasive species removal,
		    environmental education etc. These opportunites led me to getting a job in the environmental field and I am so grateful. 
		    After hearing about how desired GIS skills are in the field, I decided to take the GIS program at Fleming College. 
		    One of my favourite classes is remote sensing, can't wait to learn more! </p>
